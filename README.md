# Khiski Khopadi Journey - Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my personal journey through Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented primarily in Python. It includes standard algorithm implementations, solutions to textbook problems (Karumanchi), and various interview questions.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `algos_recap`
A collection of standard algorithms and data structure exercises for revision and practice.
*   **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort.
*   **Trees**: BST checks, Height calculation, Level order traversals, Node counting.
*   **General**: Binary Search, Bitonic Peak, Factorial, Fractional Knapsack, Greedy examples, Permutations, and more.

### 2. `karumanchi`
Implementations and solutions referenced from Narasimha Karumanchi's *Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy*.
*   **Linked List**: Comprehensive implementations of Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists with various operations.
*   **Stacks**: Balanced Parenthesis problem.
*   **Other**: Connected Cells problem.

### 3. `random_interviews`
A mix of solutions to random interview questions and coding challenges.
*   **Concurrency**: Multiprocessing and Multithreading examples.
*   **Problems**:
    *   Bear and Steady Gene
    *   Cycle detection in Linked Lists
    *   Standardize Mobile Number
    *   T-Shirts distribution problem
